# Q2. Difference Between Arrays and Linked Lists.
**1.Memory Allocation;**

Arrays are collections of types of homogeneous data elements stored in <ins> **contiguous memory** </ins> locations. This means that the elements of the array are stored next to each other in a single, uninterrupted sequence in memory. Arrays require a fixed size to be defined upfront (e.g. int array[45]). This fixed allocation can lead to memory wastage if the reserved space is not fully used.

Whilst, in a linked list memory is allocated <ins>**dynamically and non contigously**</ins>, where memory for each node is allocated at runtime as needed, allowing for efficient use of memory without predefined limits. Nodes are connected by the use of pointers .This flexibility reduces memory waste since the linked list can grow or shrink based on actual requirements, making it a better choice when memory needs are not known.

**2.Performance;**

Arrays provide constant time complexity O(1) for accessing elements by their index .

Whilst for linked lists, they use linear time complexities O(n) in order to access elements. You therefore have to traverse through each node one by one from the head or tail in doubly linked lists inorder to access the node that you want.

**3.Insertion and Deletion Operations;**

In Arrays,Inserting an element at the beginning or middle requires all subsequent elements to shift inorder to make space and this results in a O(n) worst case complexity.

Deletion also results in a O(n) linear complexity as the remaining elements must shift inorder to fill the gap left.

In Linked lists, if you have a pointer to the insertion point, results in a O(1) constant complexity whilst if you don't have a pointer, finding the insertion point takes O(n).

Deletion also results in a O(n) constant complexity if you have a pointer reference to the node that is to be deleted. Otherwise, finding the node to delete takes O(n).
