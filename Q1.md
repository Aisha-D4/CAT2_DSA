# Q1: Big O Notation in Algorithm Analysis.
Big O Notation is a concept used to describe/analyze the efficiency or performance of an algorithms as the amount of data it processes increases.It is used to measure how quickly an algorithm grows relative to the input size (n) given.It can be used to describe time and space complexities of an algorithm as it grows as the size of the inputs increases.Big O focuses on the worst time scenario.
## Rules of Big O Notation.
1. **Ignore Constants** - Constants are irrelevant in how the runtime grows as input size increases.

Example:O(3n2+5) → O(n2)

2. **Focus on the Dominant Term** -  The term with the highest growth rate will overshadow the other terms as input size grows.

Example:O(n3+4n2)→O(n3) as n3 grows faster than n2.

3. **Different Inputs are represented by Different Variables.**-An Algorithm that has different inputs ,should be represented by different variables.

Example:O(m+n).

4. **Worst Case Scenario-**

Big O typically focuses on the worst case scenario as it assumes that the algorithm performs at its least efficient and this ensures that we account for the maximum possible usage an algorithm may require.

Example:O(n).

5. **Multiply for Nested Loops-**

If an algorithm has nested operations, the total complexity is the product of complexities of each step.  

Example:O(n)*O(n)=O(n2)


### Examples of Big O Notations.
1.Constant Time:O(1); This means that the operation takes the same amount of time regardless of the input size.(Doesn't depend on the input size).

2.Linear Time:O(n);This means that the algorithm's runtime grows linearly with the input size.

3.Quadratic Time:O(n2); The algorithm's runtime grows proportionally to the square of the input size.

4.Logarithmic time:O(log n);The algorithm's runtime grows logarithmically as the input size increases.

5.Exponential Time:O(2n); The runtime grows doubles with each additional input size.
